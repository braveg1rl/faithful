# Faithful [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/meryn/faithful.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/meryn/faithful)

Like [Async](https://github.com/caolan/async), but employing promises.

## Usage

Faithful mimics the [Async](https://github.com/caolan/async) API, with three important differences:

* the functions don't have a callback argument
* the functions return a [Promises/A+](http://promises-aplus.github.io/promises-spec/) promise (powered by [RSVP.js](https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js))
* the iterator is not passed a callback argument. Instead, an iterator is expected to return a promise.

Currently, faithful only implements `each`, `eachSeries`, `map`, and `mapSeries`.

### faithful.each

```coffee
faithful = require "faithful"
faithful.each(inputs, iterator)
  .then ->
    console.log "Everything has executed."
  .then null, (error) ->
    console.error error
```

`faithful.eachSeries` works the same, but ensures the iterator is not called with the next argument until the promise returned by the previous iterator has resolved.

`each` and `eachSeries` are also available as `forEach` and `forEachSeries`, respectively.

### faithful.map

```coffee
faithful = require "faithful"
faithful.map(inputs, iterator)
  .then (outputs) ->
    console.log outputs
  .then null, (error) ->
    console.error error
```

`faithful.mapSeries` works the same, but ensures the iterator is not called with the next argument until the promise returned by the previous iterator has resolved.
