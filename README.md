# faithfully

Like [Async](https://github.com/caolan/async), but employing promises.

## Usage

Faithfully mimics the [Async](https://github.com/caolan/async) API, with three important differences:

* the functions don't have a callback argument
* the functions return a [Promises/A+](http://promises-aplus.github.io/promises-spec/) promise (powered by [RSVP.js](https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js))
* the iterator is not passed a callback argument. Instead, an iterator is expected to return a promise.

Currently, Faithfully only implements `each`, `eachSeries`, `map`, and `mapSeries`.

### faithfully.each

```coffee
faithfully = require "faithfully"
faithfully.each(inputs, iterator)
  .then ->
    console.log "Everything has executed."
  .then null, (err)
    console.error error
```

`faithfully.eachSeries` works the same, but ensures the iterator is not called with the next argument until the promise returned by the previous iterator has resolved.

`each` and `eachSeries` are also available as `forEach` and `forEachSeries`, respectively.

### faithfully.map

```coffee
faithfully = require "faithfully"
faithfully.map(inputs, iterator)
  .then (outputs) ->
    console.log outputs
  .then null, (err)
    console.error error
```

`faithfully.mapSeries` works the same, but ensures the iterator is not called with the next argument until the promise returned by the previous iterator has resolved.
